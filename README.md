About

img2text is an application that converts images into ASCII art. This enables you to display images directly in your terminal.

<img src="/Images/logo.png" width="400" height="400"/><img src="/Images/logo_txt.png" width="400" height="400"/>

Execution
---------
To download and execute image to text, run the commands below:
```
git clone https://github.com/Yassine-SABIR/img2txt
cd img2txt
python -m pip install -r requirement.txt
python img2txt.py --help
```

Usage
---------
Once you have installed img2text and its dependencies, you can use it to convert images into ASCII art. Here's a basic usage example:
```
python img2txt.py my_image.jpg
```
This will generate an ASCII representation of the specified image in the terminal. You can also use various options to adjust the output image size. See the --help output for more details.
